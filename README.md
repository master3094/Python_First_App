# Python_First_App
This is my first app code in Python 3.
Use to make Bill of Quantities for my company construction automatically.
From available drawings files in Autocad, all data of observed objects will be saved as log.txt file.
(These log file can be created by using List and log commands in Autocad in a few seconds) - 
There are two main type of observed objects: **text** and **polyline**. Some properties like: [coordinate, content, layer, color ] of text and [area, length and coordinate] of polylines are required as the input. Then my code will process these infomations and then out put the results in detail to company's Excel file. 
I used tkinter module to built a simple UI for my team.

Example:
- log.file: "Example_polyline.log" & "Example_text.log") 
- GUI : "GUI.png"
- Preview of result: "Output_preview.png"
